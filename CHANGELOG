0.6 (Nov 12, 2019) -- Only for export

- New DataLab subcommand 'ria-export-archive' for exporting a local annex
  object store into a 7z archive for use with the RIA special remote.
- Ongoing data transfers are now using a remote-specific temporary directory
  to prevent collisions.

0.5 (Sep 27, 2019) -- Speed!

- Communication with an SSH host is now done via a persistent remote shell
  session. This massively reduces the command latency on systems that are
  slow in providing a new session.
- Further minimization of the number of commands that are executed on
  remote systems.

0.4 (Aug 20, 2019) -- Tests!

- Package now called 'ria-remote' on PyPi
- Make data store layout compatible with a co-located bare repository,
  by moving the object tree under 'annex/objects'
- Add layout version files to the global data store, and to each
  dataset directory. For any newly created store they will be added
  automatically. For existing stores the special remote will refuse
  to write into unversioned locations, unless forced
  (config variable `force-write`)
- Fix issue with inappropriate exception type that `annexremote` did not
  convert into a proper message for git-annex
- Reduce number of required SSH invokations for 'checkpresent'
- Significantly expanded test coverage for various use cases

0.3 (Jul 09, 2019) -- ready?

- All functionality implemented
- Tests for major use cases, and git-annex compatibility
- Travis CI setup
- Some documentation

0.2 (May 15, 2019) -- make it run

- All desired functionality for a usable draft

0.1 (May 14, 2019) -- don't touch this

- Initial draft implementation
